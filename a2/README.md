# Shortest Path using Breadth-First Search algorithm

We implement the BFS algorithm to find the shortest distance between any two vertices, i.e., any two intersections. 

Inorder to try them, make sure you have CMake installed and then follow the instruction sequence:

cd a2 && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && make
