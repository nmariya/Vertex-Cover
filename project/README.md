# Algorithms comparison

Minisat SAT solver is available at:
```
git clone https://github.com/agurfinkel/minisat
```
You can coompile it using the commands sequence:

cd project && mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ && make

You could read the report to see the analysis of the minimal Vertex-Cover problem solution using CNF-SAT ant two other approximation techniques. The complexity and approximation ratio comparison is also given in detail.
